# DeFi Wallet Credit Score Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis presents the results of credit scoring for DeFi wallets based on Aave V2 protocol transaction data. The scoring system evaluated wallet behavior across multiple dimensions to assign credit scores ranging from 0 to 1000.

## Methodology Recap

The credit scoring system analyzes wallet behavior using six weighted components:
- **Repayment Behavior (25%)**: Loan repayment discipline
- **Transaction Consistency (20%)**: Regularity of transaction patterns
- **Protocol Engagement (15%)**: Depth of protocol usage
- **Risk Management (15%)**: Collateralization patterns
- **Liquidity Provision (10%)**: Deposit activity levels
- **Protocol Usage Diversity (10%)**: Variety of functions used
- **Liquidation Penalty (5%)**: Penalty for liquidation events
